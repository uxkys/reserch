    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    
    <h3>Starting the Game</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Open <strong>index.html</strong> in your browser. Click the link on that page to navigate to the Icon Click Game page.
      </li>
      <li>
        On the game page, click the <strong>Start</strong> button displayed at the center. This will start a 3-minute session beginning at Level 1.
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Each level consists of 12 shapes randomly placed on the screen without overlapping.
      </li>
      <li>
        One shape type appears most frequently (this is the correct answer for that level).
      </li>
      <li>
        Clicking a shape will change it (e.g., ▲ becomes △, ■ becomes □, ● becomes ○, ★ becomes ☆) and increase the click counter displayed under the corresponding button. A shape, once clicked, cannot be clicked again.
      </li>
      <li>
        At the bottom, there are four icon buttons in the following order: ●, ▲, ■, ★. Click the button corresponding to the correct shape to clear the level and move on.
      </li>
      <li>
        If an incorrect button is clicked, an alert ("Incorrect!") will be shown, and you must try again.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Level Progression &amp; Difficulty</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Levels progress automatically from Level 1 to Level 200 as you clear each level.
      </li>
      <li>
        The difficulty increases over levels by reducing the number of the correct shape. Specifically, Level 1 has 5 correct shapes, and Level 200 has 3 correct shapes, making it harder to determine which shape appears most frequently.
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Session End &amp; Data Download</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The session ends when 3 minutes have elapsed or when you clear Level 200.
      </li>
      <li>
        Upon session end, a "Download CSV" button appears at the bottom right. Clicking this button downloads a CSV file containing your play data (play count, session start/end times, and clear time for each level).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

    <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Once a shape has been clicked and changed, it cannot be clicked again.
      </li>
      <li>
        Quick decision-making is essential as the session is limited to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Your performance data for each level is recorded, allowing you to review your playing trends.
      </li>
